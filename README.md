The scripts in the repository are used to convert glif files to Turtle
[Turtle Blocks](http://walterbender.github.io/turtleblocksjs) projects.


glif2tb2.py will take a glif file, generate a separate turtle for each
knot and control point, and then render a path between those
points. By moving the position of the turtles, the rendering changes.

a2.tb is an example of the output.
